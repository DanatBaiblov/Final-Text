**Abstract**

This study delves into the nuanced evolution of Kazakhstan's political landscape over the past five years by analyzing annual addresses of the President. Against the backdrop of a presidential republic, the research scrutinizes the intricate balance of powers within the executive branch and the historical dominance of the ruling party. The hypothesis posits a significant shift in the focus of the most recent annual address, transitioning from a political to an economic emphasis, attributed to the transformative events of the January 2022 protests. The methodology employs the Natural Language Toolkit for data cleaning and Matplotlib/WordCloud for analysis, revealing dynamic patterns in governmental priorities. The findings underscore an adaptive governance approach, with a notable transition towards addressing economic challenges in 2023. Additionally, the study unveils fluctuations in the frequency of the term "president," offering insights into the evolving political dynamics and communication strategies within Kazakhstan's political landscape.
